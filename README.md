# Save-The-World
This is intended to be a 3D, open source, synchronous, interactive, world-building, 
world-exploring project in which all contributors and players are welcome. Our mission 
is to demonstrate that each person in this world can do their part to make the world a 
better place. The intention of the project is to design a dynamic world full of life with 
everything from major detailed cities to great expansive oceans and anything in 
between that will respond appropriately to the worldly stress placed upon it. Primarily, our 
objective is to incorporate global warming, pollution, and other existential crises within 
the open source platform for players to explore and address as they see fit with limitless 
creative innovation provided by the developers. Gamifying provides opportunity for 
individuals to interact on a personal level for greater accountability so that our future of 
the world is in safe hands moving forward.
